1. Audit repository and prepare environment
- Verify Next.js App Router structure with TypeScript enabled and ESLint/Prettier configured.
- Confirm presence of the listed files/paths; create any missing:
  - components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx, VerifyOtpForm.tsx, CreatePasswordForm.tsx, RoleSelectionForm.tsx
  - app/api/auth/(register|verify-email|create-password|set-role|resend-verification-code)/route.ts
  - lib/api/auth.ts, lib/server/auth-cookies.ts
  - app/(auth)/auth/(register|verify-email|create-password|set-role)/page.tsx
  - middleware.ts
  - types/auth.ts
- Add environment variables and config:
  - SERVER_API_BASE=https://fastlearnersapp.com/api/v1
  - Ensure NODE_ENV, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL if needed for redirects
- Install UI and form libs if missing: react-hook-form, zod, sonner (or shadcn/ui toast), lucide-react.
- Ensure shadcn/ui installed and configured for inputs, buttons, form, toast, skeleton.
2. Define shared config and endpoints
- Create lib/config.ts with:
  - apiBase = process.env.SERVER_API_BASE or fallback to https://fastlearnersapp.com/api/v1
  - defaultHeaders = { Accept: application/json, Content-Type: application/json }
- All client components call Next.js server routes under /api/auth/*, never the external API directly.
- Never pass tokens via URL or localStorage; only HttpOnly cookies on the same domain.
3. TypeScript types for requests, responses, and errors
- Create types/auth.ts:
  - type ApiResponse&lt;T&gt; = { success: boolean; message: string; content: T; code: number }
  - type ApiErrorField = Record&lt;string, string[]&gt;
  - type ApiError = { success: false; message: string; errors?: ApiErrorField | null; code: number }
  - type User = { id: number; name: string | null; username: string | null; email: string; phone: string | null; status: string; role: string[] }
  - type VerifySuccess = { access_token: string; user: User }
- Create discriminated unions for each endpoint’s success/error shapes to map 200, 400, 401, 404, 422, 500 precisely to UI.
4. Cookie utilities for onboarding and session
- Implement lib/server/auth-cookies.ts:
  - setRegistrationToken(token: string, maxAgeSeconds: number = 60 * 60)
    - HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax, Path=/, MaxAge ~ 1 hour
  - getRegistrationToken(): string | null
  - clearRegistrationToken()
  - setAuthSession(token: string, maxAgeSeconds: number = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7)
    - HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax, Path=/, persistent duration
  - getAuthSession(): string | null
  - clearAuthSession()
- Optionally add setUserRole(role: string) as non-HttpOnly cookie if the app needs quick client-side role hints; avoid storing PII.
5. Server route: POST /api/auth/register (proxy)
- Path: app/api/auth/register/route.ts
- Behavior:
  - Read { email } from request JSON; validate presence and string.
  - Proxy to POST https://fastlearnersapp.com/api/v1/register with headers: Accept: application/json and Content-Type: application/json.
  - On 200: return JSON to client; do not set any cookies here.
  - On 422: return errors as-is to preserve exact backend messages (e.g., The email has already been taken.).
  - Map network or unexpected errors to 500 with a safe message.
- No tokens stored. On success, client will redirect to /auth/verify-email?email=...
6. Server route: POST /api/auth/verify-email (proxy + reg_token cookie)
- Path: app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts
- Behavior:
  - Read { email, code } from request JSON; validate both present.
  - Proxy to POST https://fastlearnersapp.com/api/v1/verify-email.
  - On 200: extract content.access_token; call setRegistrationToken(access_token); return success JSON.
  - Errors to handle and forward:
    - 422 Validation failed (email/code required)
    - 404 Registration request not found!
    - 400 Invalid verification code! or Registration code has expired, try again!
- Do not expose token to client; cookie is HttpOnly.
7. Server route: POST /api/auth/resend-verification-code (proxy)
- Path: app/api/auth/resend-verification-code/route.ts
- Behavior:
  - Read { email } from request JSON; validate presence.
  - Proxy to POST https://fastlearnersapp.com/api/v1/resend-verification-code.
  - Forward 200, 422, 404, 500 responses verbatim to client.
- No cookies set here.
8. Server route: POST /api/auth/create-password (proxy with Authorization)
- Path: app/api/auth/create-password/route.ts
- Behavior:
  - Read { password, password_confirmation } from request JSON; validate both present.
  - Read reg_token from cookies via getRegistrationToken(); if missing, return 401 Unauthorized.
  - Proxy to POST https://fastlearnersapp.com/api/v1/create-password with headers:
    - Accept: application/json
    - Authorization: Bearer {reg_token}
    - Content-Type: application/json
  - On 200: return success JSON (no cookie changes yet).
  - On 422: forward validation messages exactly.
  - On 400: forward error.
  - On 401 from upstream: clearRegistrationToken(); return 401.
9. Server route: POST /api/auth/set-role (proxy + elevate to main session)
- Path: app/api/auth/set-role/route.ts
- Behavior:
  - Read { user_role, child_email?, child_phone? } from request JSON.
  - Read reg_token from cookies; if missing, return 401 Unauthorized.
  - Proxy to POST https://fastlearnersapp.com/api/v1/set-role with Authorization: Bearer {reg_token} and Accept: application/json.
  - On 200:
    - Promote onboarding token to main session:
      - setAuthSession(reg_token)
      - clearRegistrationToken()
    - Optionally request fresh profile if a profile endpoint exists; otherwise allow dashboard to fetch on mount.
    - Return success JSON.
  - On errors:
    - 422: forward validation messages.
    - 400 Invalid role selected! (note: docs label 422 but code block shows 400; forward exact upstream code and message).
    - 500 generic server error (as per docs), forward as-is.
10. API client that targets Next.js routes (never the external API directly)
- File: lib/api/auth.ts
- Functions return typed results and never throw on expected API errors; they resolve with discriminated unions for easy UI mapping.
  - register(email: string)
  - verifyEmail(email: string, code: string)
  - resendVerificationCode(email: string)
  - createPassword(password: string, passwordConfirmation: string)
  - setRole(payload: { user_role: 'student' | 'guardian' | 'guest'; child_email?: string; child_phone?: string })
- Implementation guidelines:
  - Use fetch to /api/auth/* with headers: Accept: application/json and Content-Type: application/json.
  - Use AbortController with a 15s timeout.
  - Map response.status to fine-grained result types for UI.
11. RegisterForm.tsx (email only)
- Form: one email input, primary submit button, helper text, inline errors.
- Validation:
  - Required, valid RFC email.
- Submission:
  - Call auth.register(email).
  - On 200: toast.success(message); router.push(/auth/verify-email?email=encodedEmail).
  - On 422:
    - Show inline field errors using backend strings:
      - The email field is required.
      - The email has already been taken.
  - Loading state: disable button, show spinner in button.
- Accessibility and UI:
  - Label tied to input, aria-invalid when errors.
  - Button states: hover, active, focus ring, disabled.
  - Respect color system and type scale from rules.
12. VerifyOtpForm.tsx (6-digit OTP with 60s resend)
- Inputs:
  - 6-digit code as either 6 individual boxes or a masked single input constrained to digits.
  - Email is read-only from query string; provide edit link back to register if wrong.
- Validation:
  - code required, exactly 6 digits.
- Submission:
  - Call auth.verifyEmail(email, code).
  - On 200: server sets reg_token; toast.success; router.push(/auth/create-password).
  - On 422: map field-level errors (email required, code required).
  - On 404: show Registration request not found!.
  - On 400: show Invalid verification code! or Registration code has expired, try again!.
- Resend:
  - A resend button calls auth.resendVerificationCode(email).
  - Enforce 60-second countdown; disable button until zero; show remaining seconds.
- Loading:
  - Disable inputs during submit; aria-busy on form; spinner in button.
- Security: never expose token; nothing stored in localStorage.
13. CreatePasswordForm.tsx (strong password and confirmation)
- Inputs: password, password_confirmation with show/hide toggles.
- Client validation:
  - Min 8 chars, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, one special character.
  - Passwords must match.
- Submission:
  - Call auth.createPassword(password, password_confirmation).
  - On 200: toast.success; router.push(/auth/set-role).
  - On 422: show exact messages from backend:
    - The password field is required.
    - The password confirmation field is required.
    - The password field confirmation does not match.
  - On 401: toast.error(Unauthorized. Please restart registration.); redirect to /auth/register.
  - On 400: show generic error from backend.
- UX: inline rule checklist that updates as user types, keyboard accessible.
14. RoleSelectionForm.tsx (student or guardian with optional child info)
- Controls:
  - Radio group: student, guardian, guest (include guest per docs but hide if not used; validation must still permit it).
  - If guardian is selected, show child_email and child_phone (both optional as per testing checklist).
- Validation:
  - user_role required; child_email must be valid email if provided; child_phone pattern basic digits with optional separators.
- Submission:
  - Call auth.setRole({ user_role, child_email?, child_phone? }).
  - On 200:
    - Server route promotes reg_token to auth_token and clears reg_token.
    - toast.success(Your role has been set successfully!)
    - router.replace(/dashboard) to avoid going back.
  - On 422: show The user role field is required. and any other validation errors.
  - On 400: show Invalid role selected!.
  - On 500: show There was an error assigning role, try again.
- After redirect, dashboard loads with auth_token present; fetch profile server-side for personalization.
15. Auth pages wiring and guards
- app/(auth)/auth/register/page.tsx
  - Server component that renders RegisterForm. No guard.
- app/(auth)/auth/verify-email/page.tsx
  - Read email from search params; if missing, link back to register.
  - Render VerifyOtpForm with provided email.
- app/(auth)/auth/create-password/page.tsx
  - Server component: if no reg_token cookie, redirect to /auth/register.
  - Render CreatePasswordForm.
- app/(auth)/auth/set-role/page.tsx
  - Server component: if no reg_token cookie, redirect to /auth/register.
  - Render RoleSelectionForm.
- Provide minimal page transitions and consistent layout; mobile-first spacing.
16. Middleware to protect private routes and allow auth routes
- middleware.ts:
  - Protect routes like /dashboard and other app pages by checking auth_token cookie.
  - Exclude:
    - /^/auth/ (all onboarding and login-related)
    - /^/api/auth/ (server routes)
    - Static assets, next internal.
  - If missing auth_token on protected routes, redirect to /auth/login or /auth/register depending on entry point.
- Ensure onboarding pages are not blocked by middleware.
17. Toasts, loading states, and error handling conventions
- Use a single toast provider (e.g., shadcn or sonner) in root layout.
- Show:
  - Success toasts on 200 with backend message.
  - Inline field errors for 422 mapped directly from errors.email, errors.password, etc.
  - Non-field errors via alert region under form or toast.
- Loading:
  - Disable buttons during async; show spinner icon and aria-live on status region.
- Remove console.log from production; add try/catch with friendly messages and retry affordances where reasonable.
18. Visual and accessibility standards
- Colors and typography:
  - Use the provided palette, 60-30-10 rule, type scale, and consistent radii (rounded-lg for buttons and inputs).
- States:
  - Every interactive element with default, hover, active, focus, disabled per rules; focus ring visible.
- Animations:
  - Subtle, purposeful transitions: transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out.
- Accessibility:
  - Proper labels, described-by for errors, keyboard navigation, sufficient contrast, 44px touch targets, semantic HTML.
- Icons:
  - Use a single icon set (e.g., Lucide) with consistent sizes.
19. Client-side validation schemas and helpers
- Create zod schemas:
  - registerSchema: { email: z.string().email() }
  - verifySchema: { email: z.string().email(), code: z.string().regex(/^\d{6}$/) }
  - passwordSchema: { password: strongPasswordRegex, password_confirmation: z.string().min(8) } with refine to match
  - roleSchema: { user_role: z.enum(['student','guardian','guest']), child_email?: z.string().email().optional(), child_phone?: z.string().min(7).optional() }
- Provide mapZodToBackend to prioritize backend messages over client ones when both exist, displaying backend text exactly as in docs.
20. Navigation and redirect behavior
- After register: redirect to /auth/verify-email?email=...
- After verify: redirect to /auth/create-password
- After create-password: redirect to /auth/set-role
- After set-role: redirect to /dashboard (UI decides experience based on role)
- Use router.replace for final redirect to prevent back navigation into onboarding.
- Preserve email across steps only via query param on verify-email step; never store tokens in URL or localStorage.
21. Security hardening and edge cases
- Cookies:
  - HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax, Path=/ for reg_token and auth_token.
  - Clear reg_token immediately after successful role set.
- CSRF:
  - App-only server routes, JSON-only with same-site cookies mitigate CSRF. Consider double-submit token for state-changing actions if required later.
- Rate limit UI:
  - Disable resend button until countdown finishes; also debounce submit to prevent accidental multiple requests.
- Empty or expired reg_token during create-password and set-role:
  - Return 401 from server routes; UI should restart onboarding at /auth/register with guidance.
22. Testing checklist and scenarios
- Registration with valid email → redirects to verify-email.
- Registration with existing email → shows The email has already been taken.
- Registration with invalid email → shows The email field is required. or RFC validation error.
- OTP verification valid → redirects to create-password and sets reg_token cookie.
- OTP invalid → shows Invalid verification code!.
- OTP expired → shows Registration code has expired, try again!.
- Resend code → sends new code and starts 60-second countdown.
- Create password valid → redirects to set-role.
- Create password mismatched → shows confirmation does not match.
- Set role student → redirects to /dashboard, reg_token cleared, auth_token present.
- Set role guardian with child info → redirects to /dashboard.
- Set role guardian without child info → accepted (fields optional).
- All API calls include Accept: application/json.
- No tokens in URL or localStorage.
- All success/error toasts appear; inline errors mapped for 422.
- Dark and light mode visual checks; keyboard navigation, focus visible.
- Middleware excludes onboarding and protects dashboard.
23. Documentation and handoff
- Update README with:
  - Environment variables and how to run.
  - Auth flow diagram and endpoints.
  - Cookie lifecycle: reg_token to auth_token.
  - Testing instructions and known edge cases.
- Comment code where non-obvious (especially server routes and cookie utils).
- Ensure no TypeScript errors and no console errors before merge.

Look at this:
There is a role-selection page already but for some reason i cannot select the role (student or guardian). I don't want it to show "Your role has been selected. Go to dashboard." It should either be the role for students and for guardian side-by-side just as it is in the page in this role selection page already. So that once the role is being clicked it takes them to their respective dashboards. The Flow should be as the password is being created. On the role page it shows "Select your role": Student or guardian. Once either role is selected it is assigned to the user and pushed to the backend endpoint. Then that is redirected to the respective role of either Student or guardian. I really don't want any complicated logic for the rule selection. You should make sure that once the rule is selected it is being pushed to the API endpoints so that the user's information can be updated and the rule can be viewed and carry out its respective functions.

i'm thinking that for the guardian role selection, there should be another section that would collect more information like: Full name, number, etc. (As the structure is from the JSON of what  the guardian role structure looks like) along with both child_email and child_phone, which is compulsry to fill before proceeding to the dashboard

Look at this suggestion:
I have the following comments after thorough review of file. Implement the comments by following the instructions verbatim.

---
## Comment 1: Middleware matcher excludes auth only at the root, causing it to still run on (auth)/auth/* routes.

In middleware.ts, update config.matcher to explicitly exclude all auth pages by using a more precise pattern or an array. Replace the current matcher with one that excludes ^/api, ^/_next, ^/favicon.ico, and all paths under ^/auth(/.*)?. Verify that pages in (auth)/auth/* are matched as /auth/* and are excluded. Test login, register, verify-email, reset-password to ensure middleware does not run there.

### Relevant Files
- \middleware.ts
---
## Comment 2: User object is stored in an HttpOnly cookie (auth_user), increasing size and exposure risk; only token/expiry should be kept.

In lib/server/auth-cookies.ts, remove writing AUTH_USER_COOKIE and stop reading it in parseAuthCookiesServer. Keep only AUTH_TOKEN_COOKIE and AUTH_EXPIRES_COOKIE. Update /app/api/auth/session/route.ts to fetch user data from the backend using the bearer token (e.g., call /api/auth/me or upstream /profile) and return { user }. Adjust middleware.ts to rely on a lighter server-only session check (e.g., verify token expiration from auth_expires and avoid parsing user JSON).

### Relevant Files
- \lib\server\auth-cookies.ts
- \app\api\auth\session\route.ts
- \middleware.ts
- \app\api\auth\me\route.ts
---
## Comment 3: Multiple cookie helpers define names separately, risking drift between middleware, client helpers, and server helpers.

Create a single source of truth for cookie names and options (e.g., lib/server/cookie-constants.ts). Export AUTH_TOKEN_COOKIE, AUTH_EXPIRES_COOKIE, and any transitional names. Import these in middleware.ts, lib/server/auth-cookies.ts, lib/auth-cookies.ts, and API routes to eliminate string duplication. Replace hard-coded strings with imports in all files reading or writing cookies.

### Relevant Files
- \middleware.ts
- \lib\auth-cookies.ts
- \lib\server\auth-cookies.ts
- \app\api\auth\*\route.ts
- \app\api\proxy\[...path]\route.ts
---
## Comment 4: Middleware trusts client-set cookies (auth_user) directly instead of validating token or consulting server session.

Modify middleware.ts to avoid parsing auth_user. Instead, read only auth_token and auth_expires. For role-based routing, either: (a) embed minimal claims (user id, primary role) in a signed cookie; or (b) add a short-lived auth_claims cookie signed and validated server-side. Update middleware to validate signature and extract role/id, or perform a fast verification step. Remove reliance on auth_user entirely.

### Relevant Files
- \middleware.ts
- \lib\server\auth-cookies.ts
---
## Comment 5: Both middleware and client-side ProtectedRoute/protected layout perform auth redirects, causing duplicate navigations and flicker.

Standardize on server-side gating. Keep middleware as the source of truth. Simplify ProtectedRoute and (protected)/layout.tsx to assume access has been granted by middleware; remove redundant redirects and hydrate-only for personalization. Alternatively, remove middleware gating and enforce checks in layouts with server components and route handlers. Do not do both.

### Relevant Files
- \middleware.ts
- \components\auth\ProtectedRoute.tsx
- \app\(protected)\layout.tsx
---
## Comment 6: /api/auth/session only parses cookies and returns user; it should validate token and refresh or 401 with consistent shape.

Change /app/api/auth/session/route.ts to: read auth_token and auth_expires, return 401 if expired/missing, call upstream /profile with the token, and return { success: true, user }. Ensure all client hydration (useAuthStore.hydrate) uses only this endpoint. Update any callers expecting a different shape.

### Relevant Files
- \app\api\auth\session\route.ts
- \store\authStore.ts
---
## Comment 7: Proxy route reads cookie directly and forwards Authorization; consolidate reading token and error handling.

Import and use parseAuthCookiesServer from lib/server/auth-cookies.ts within the proxy route. If no valid token or expired, return 401 JSON with a consistent shape. Build the Authorization header from auth.token. Replace direct cookies().get("auth_token") reads.

### Relevant Files
- \app\api\proxy\[...path]\route.ts
- \lib\server\auth-cookies.ts
---
## Comment 8: RBAC allowed/restricted routes are a mix of prefixes; some protected dashboard subpaths may not be covered.

Audit all protected app routes and expand allowedRoutes to include the smallest stable prefixes (e.g., /dashboard, /dashboard/teacher, /dashboard/admin, /dashboard/superadmin). Add explicit allowances for nested pages actually used. Prefer a declarative route map or regexp patterns to avoid accidental denials. Add tests for typical paths.

### Relevant Files
- \lib\rbac\role-config.ts
- \app\(protected)\**\page.tsx
---
## Comment 9: Cookies use sameSite: 'lax' which may be okay, but sensitive flows may prefer strict and domain scoping.

In lib/server/auth-cookies.ts, change sameSite to 'strict' for AUTH_TOKEN_COOKIE and AUTH_EXPIRES_COOKIE in production if it doesn't break cross-site flows. Optionally set domain to your app domain from env. Validate that OAuth/callback flows still function with Strict; otherwise fallback to Lax but add CSRF verification in state parameter for OAuth and double-submit cookie pattern where applicable.

### Relevant Files
- \lib\server\auth-cookies.ts
---
## Comment 10: Verbose console logging in middleware leaks cookie presence and roles in server logs.

In middleware.ts, remove or guard all console.log statements with a check like if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_AUTH === 'true'). Remove the code that logs all cookie names. Keep logs minimal and non-identifying.

### Relevant Files
- \middleware.ts
---
## Comment 11: useAuthInit and authStore.hydrate introduce dual loading flags that may keep the UI in loading longer than necessary.

Ensure hydrate() is invoked only once globally (e.g., in RootLayout or a top-level Provider). Simplify useAuthInit to return a single ready flag derived solely from store state. Remove extra hydrate() calls from pages like (protected)/dashboard/page.tsx.

### Relevant Files
- \hooks\useAuthInit.ts
- \store\authStore.ts
- \app\(protected)\dashboard\page.tsx
---
## Comment 12: Google OAuth flow in LoginForm is a placeholder and not integrated with backend or CSRF/state checks.

Remove or hide the Google login button until the /api/auth/google/callback flow is fully implemented with state/nonce, client IDs from env, and token exchange on the server that sets cookies via setAuthCookiesServer. Replace hard-coded client_id with env vars and wire the backend endpoints.

### Relevant Files
- \components\auth\LoginForm.tsx
- \app\api\auth\google\callback\route.ts
---
## Comment 13: Axios client still references token from client cookies when NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_HTTPONLY_AUTH is false, creating two modes and edge cases.

Remove NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_HTTPONLY_AUTH toggle and the lib/auth-cookies.ts legacy helpers. Ensure all API calls go through server proxy or carry no Authorization header from the browser. Update apiClient to never set Authorization in the browser; only server routes should forward tokens.

### Relevant Files
- \lib\api\client.ts
- \lib\auth-cookies.ts
- \store\authStore.ts
---
## Comment 14: getHomeRoute('guest') returns /auth/set-role, but middleware separately handles guest redirection; potential duplicate behavior.

In middleware.ts, handle guest users before the AUTH_ROUTES redirect for authenticated users. Ensure that if role is guest, navigation to /auth/* pages is allowed only for role selection and onboarding pages as defined in ROLE_CONFIGURATIONS.guest.allowedRoutes. Remove overlapping redirects.

### Relevant Files
- \middleware.ts
- \lib\rbac\role-config.ts
---
## Comment 15: /api/auth/me duplicates functionality of session endpoint and directly reads cookie names.

Replace /api/auth/me with logic inside /api/auth/session or make it call session internally. Update clients (if any) to rely on /api/auth/session only. Keep /api/auth/me as a thin alias that forwards to session for back-compat.

### Relevant Files
- \app\api\auth\me\route.ts
- \app\api\auth\session\route.ts
- \lib\api\auth.ts
---
## Comment 16: Middleware runs at the edge; using large JSON parsing and debug logs may be slow and exceed edge execution expectations.

Refactor middleware to only read auth_token and expiry, or a small signed auth_claims string. Remove JSON.parse of user data. Drop console logging in production. Keep the edge path lean to reduce latency.

### Relevant Files
- \middleware.ts
- \lib\server\auth-cookies.ts
---
## Comment 17: AUTH_ROUTES contains only login/register; missing other auth pages like verify-email, create-password, etc.

Expand AUTH_ROUTES to include all authentication pages where authenticated users should not land (e.g., /auth/verify-email, /auth/forgot-password, /auth/create-password, /auth/reset-password, /auth/set-role depending on role). Update logic to exclude role-selection for guests.

I have the following comments after thorough review of file. Implement the comments by following the instructions verbatim.

---
## Comment 1: Settings page loads profile via axios to backend without auth header in HttpOnly mode, causing 401 and forced redirect.

In lib/api/profile.ts, stop calling the external API directly. Replace all calls with the app’s internal API routes.
- For GET profile: call /api/auth/session and return data.user.
- For POST profile edit: create app/api/profile/edit/route.ts that reads auth_token from cookies via parseAuthCookiesServer() and proxies to ${BASE}/profile/edit with Authorization: Bearer {token}; update updateProfile() to POST to /api/profile/edit.
- For POST password change: create app/api/profile/edit/password/route.ts with the same proxy pattern to ${BASE}/profile/edit/password; update changePassword() to POST to /api/profile/edit/password.
- Remove axios usage in lib/api/profile.ts and use fetch() to the internal routes with Accept: application/json and Content-Type: application/json.
- Rebuild and test visiting /dashboard/settings to confirm no redirect occurs and data loads.

Hey chat, what's good? now i want to continue on the project and work on the subject selection and lessons interface. I will be splitting it into 2 parts. The first part will be on the subject selection and the second part will be on the Lessons.
Let's say i have a student who has successfully signed up on the platform, now they need to register their subject based on the nigerian system. the flow is supposed to be from VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE: "class selection -> subject ->  term selection -> topic selection -> lessons". This pattern applys to all students, but as you should know, Senior secondary is different from Junior secondary. read the attached docs to get more context.

# Applying the Design Patterns and Concepts of Leading Interactive Learning Platforms

The success of platforms like Brilliant, Udemy, Skillshare, Sana Labs, and Duolingo is not accidental; it is the result of meticulously engineered learning experiences that blend pedagogical science with engaging user interface design and powerful gamification logic. By deconstructing their core strategies, you can apply proven concepts to your own educational project, whether it is a corporate training module, a mobile app, or an online course.

This analysis synthesizes the key takeaways into three actionable categories: **Logic and Learning Methodology**, **Design and Style**, and **Gamification and Engagement Logic**.

## 1. Logic and Learning Methodology

This category addresses the "how" of content delivery and the underlying pedagogical approach.

| Platform Example | Core Concept | Description | Actionable Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Duolingo, Brilliant** | **Bite-Sized, Sequential Learning** | Content is broken down into small, manageable chunks (5-10 minutes) that are structured in a clear, linear progression. This reduces cognitive load and maintains momentum. | **Chunking:** Divide your curriculum into micro-lessons. Ensure each lesson has a single, clearly defined learning objective and builds directly on the previous one. |
| **Brilliant** | **Interactive Problem-Solving** | Learning is driven by active engagement, not passive consumption. Users learn by manipulating variables, solving puzzles, and exploring concepts hands-on. | **Active Recall:** Replace long video lectures or text blocks with interactive elements, quizzes, and simulations that require the user to apply knowledge immediately. |
| **Skillshare, Udemy** | **Project-Based Learning** | The learning goal is often a tangible outcome (e.g., a finished painting, a working piece of code). This provides practical context and a clear measure of success. | **Outcome Focus:** Structure your course around a final project. Frame each lesson as a necessary step toward completing that project, providing a strong sense of purpose. |
| **Sana Labs** | **AI-Powered Personalization** | Uses machine learning to analyze user performance, identify knowledge gaps, and dynamically adjust the content, difficulty, and pace of the learning path. | **Adaptive Testing:** Implement a system that tracks user mastery. If a user struggles with a concept, automatically serve review material or prerequisite lessons before allowing them to advance. |

## 2. Design and Style

The visual presentation and user experience (UX) are critical for reducing friction and keeping the user focused.

*   **Minimalist and Focused UI:** All successful platforms prioritize content over clutter. They use **ample white space**, clear, high-contrast typography, and a limited color palette. The primary goal is to minimize distractions and keep the user focused on the current task or lesson.
    *   **Strategy:** Adopt a clean, modern display. Avoid unnecessary sidebars, pop-ups, or complex navigation within the learning environment itself.
*   **Visual Feedback and Delight:** Immediate and clear feedback is essential. When a user answers a question, the response should be instant, visually satisfying (e.g., a green checkmark animation), and informative.
    *   **Strategy:** Use **micro-animations** and **sound effects** to celebrate correct answers and soften the blow of incorrect ones. Ensure progress indicators (like progress bars or lesson completion icons) are always visible.
*   **Consistent Visual Language:** A strong, consistent brand identity (e.g., Duolingo's friendly green and owl mascot) makes the app feel reliable and familiar.
    *   **Strategy:** Develop a style guide with a consistent color scheme, font usage, and tone of voice. If applicable, use a mascot or recurring visual motif to guide the user.

## 3. Gamification and Engagement Logic

Gamification is the engine that drives daily engagement and transforms learning from a chore into a habit.

| Concept | Platform Example | Implementation Detail | Strategy for Your Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Streaks and Habit Formation** | **Duolingo** | The "Streak" mechanic encourages users to return daily to avoid losing their progress. This leverages the psychological principle of loss aversion. | **Implement a Daily Goal:** Set a small, achievable daily goal (e.g., "Complete 1 lesson"). Use push notifications or email reminders to prompt users to maintain their streak. |
| **Points, Levels, and Badges** | **Duolingo, Brilliant** | Users earn Experience Points (XP) for completing tasks, level up, and unlock badges for achieving milestones (e.g., "Master of Basics"). | **Reward Effort:** Award points for every completed action. Use badges to recognize significant achievements, such as completing a module, spending a certain amount of time learning, or mastering a difficult concept. |
| **Leaderboards and Competition** | **Duolingo** | Users are placed into leagues and compete against others to earn the most XP in a week. This taps into extrinsic motivation. | **Foster Community:** If appropriate for your audience, introduce a leaderboard or a "challenge mode" where users can compete with friends or peers. Ensure the competition is friendly and focused on learning effort. |
| **Virtual Currency/Incentives** | **Duolingo** | Users earn "Gems" or "Lingots" that can be spent on virtual items, streak freezes, or bonus content. | **Create a Store:** Introduce a virtual currency earned through learning. Allow users to spend this currency on cosmetic items, access to bonus materials, or helpful in-app tools. |

By systematically integrating these proven design patterns—from the micro-interactions of gamification to the macro-structure of personalized, bite-sized content—you can create a highly effective and engaging interactive learning experience.

Good since you have the full context how, let's begin and only focus on only the subject selection for now. i use typescript. i would like to use components cuz it's faster to debug and i think it's a good practice. i use cursor and the problem with it is that it usually messes up the UI design style have and it's not consistent with all interface. i love and prefer shadcn/ui + aceternity ui. i get components from them both and from https://www.shadcn.io/.  i am building on "https://github.com/mickasmt/next-saas-stripe-starter" and using it as my base and thinking of repurposeing the /blog/ to create and run the subject selection and make it better. i had previously created demo subjects and lessons route which exsist at '/dashboard/subjects' and '/dashboard/lessons' respectfully with fake data and some children pages under them. I will need a great ui for these phase, and i want you to give me the best way, guide and prompts to use. Do you need to see the current project file structure?

You can suggest other necessary components from shadcn/ui + aceternity-ui to install and add to the project.
